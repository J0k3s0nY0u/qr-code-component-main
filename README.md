### What I learned

This project gave me a bit of nostalgia on how basic styles may prove to be challenging no matter how experienced you are. I had to refactor the code multiple times using different methods before I got a centralized image within its container div. It was fun stressful and surprisingly enjoyable. I recommend this project to anyone of any interest. No matter what level of expertise you're in, I assure you you'll enjoy it too.

### Continued development

I am still not comfortable with how I centralized the container div as well as its children. I will look up on centralizing objects more in response to future projects.

### Useful resources

- [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-center-an-image-in-a-div-css/) - This helped me to centre the image and its container div. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30811779/keeping-a-div-the-same-size-no-matter-the-screen-resolution) - This is an amazing solution which helped me finally understand the necessity of different dimensions in web development. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
